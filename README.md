# Hello_World
My first repository, I have no clue what is going on, but I guess I ll figure it out.


(13/4/22) Update:
Baby steps...! I started this read me for SQL but I got super excited about python...
So I am going to put in my first python code. Hopefully -in an unknow amount of time - later I will be able to come back and check my progress.
I am currently in a 1+1 = 2 stage.. sooo let's see!
